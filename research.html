                <p class="research-meta">AidData at William & Mary (2025)</p>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>Balancing Risk and Reward traces how China has become Indonesia’s most significant source of development finance and foreign direct investment (FDI). Produced by AidData in partnership with Foreign Policy Talks, this report systematically decodes the money, relationships, and outcomes from more than two decades of Beijing’s investments in Indonesia. We leverage AidData’s global dataset of Chinese development finance projects and the Financial Times’ fDi Markets platform to analyze the character and nature of nearly $70 billion in Beijing’s state-backed finance from 2000 to 2023 and over $94 billion in private Chinese FDI from 2010 to 2024, ground-truthing this with Foreign Policy Talks’ local networks of experts. We untangle the vast network of players involved in Beijing’s development finance projects in Indonesia, including 58 Chinese state-owned financiers, 208 co-financiers from Asia, Europe, and North America, 213 implementers, and 206 recipient entities. Finally, we uncover the extent to which China follows through on its promised commitments, how it manages the risk of public harm from its projects, and the downstream effects across Indonesian society.</p>

                <h3>Shaping Governance Narratives through Divergent Migrant Labour Statistics within ASEAN: Evidence from Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand</h3>
                <p class="research-meta">Perantau: Journal of Migration, Borders, and Belonging (2025)</p>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>While ASEAN increasingly relies on migrant labour, the numbers used to describe that reliance are anything but neutral. Yet little work shows how states actively choose among competing datasets to craft regional policy narratives. This article examines how Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand deploy different migrant-labour statistics in ASEAN forums to legitimise control, minimise perceived dependence, or claim policy success. Our objective is to unpack the politics of “strategic counting” and its consequences for regional coordination. Methodologically, we build a discrepancy matrix (2010–2024) comparing UN DESA International Migrant Stock, ILO–ILMS labour indicators, ASEAN Statistical Yearbooks, and national administrative figures; we then code how specific numbers are cited in AFML/ALMM documents and related government statements. We find consistent gaps; often tens of percentage points are driven by definition (foreign-born vs. non-resident vs. registered workers), timing, and inclusion of irregular migrants. Governments repeatedly select the figure that best supports a preferred storyline of competence or limited exposure. These results imply that data harmonisation is not a mere technical fix but a governance challenge: without transparent metadata and agreed definitions, ASEAN cooperation on migrant protection will continue to rest on incompatible evidence bases.</p>

                <h3>The Shift from Paradiplomacy to Protodiplomacy: A Comparative Study of Catalonia and Kurdistan</h3>
                <p class="research-meta">Journal of Paradiplomacy and City Networks (2024)</p>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>This article explored the transition from paradiplomacy to protodiplomacy in Catalonia and Kurdistan, two regions at the forefront of this shift. Protodiplomacy involves the direct participation of subnational entities in diplomatic activities akin to those of recognized nation-states, challenging traditional diplomatic hierarchies and altering the global diplomatic landscape. Catalonia has greater autonomy in matters such as governance and economy, while Kurdistan has more limited autonomy in matters such as security and governance. As such, this research showed that paradiplomacy could serve as a means to increase regional engagement in international politics. This research provided an in-depth analysis of how the South Sulawesi Provincial Government's paradiplomacy initiative impacts the export of agricultural products to Egypt. Through a comparative analysis of Catalonia and Kurdistan, this study elucidated the motivations, consequences, and challenges associated with this transition. It emphasized the significance of effective paradiplomacy practices between central and local governments. Catalonia and Iraqi Kurdistan exemplified modern paradiplomacy, showcasing their capabilities on an international stage. The research identified high Iraqi Kurdish nationalism as a key driver of the shift towards protodiplomacy in Kurdistan. It also highlighted the internal structural factors within Iraq that propelled Iraqi Kurdistan's diplomatic efforts, culminating in a referendum that marked a peak in separatist interest. This research underscored the dynamic nature of protodiplomacy, highlighting the motivations behind subnational diplomatic endeavors and the transformative implications for central-local government relations.</p>

                <h3>Transforming Indonesia's Informal Sector: The Role of Industrialization in Manufacturing Industry</h3>
                <p class="research-meta">Conference Proceeding (2023)</p>
                  <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>This study analyzes the need for Indonesia's massive industrialization in the manufacturing industry to address the persistent issue of informal employment. Indonesia's economy depends heavily on the informal sector, leading to a high unemployment rate and limited social protection. This study aims to explore the manufacturing industry's potential to create more formal employment opportunities and reduce informal employment. The objectives include analyzing the current state of the manufacturing industry, identifying the challenges and opportunities for growth, and proposing policy recommendations to promote industrialization. A qualitative research approach was used, with data collected through literature reviews, government reports, and library research. The study found that the manufacturing industry in Indonesia has excellent growth potential, given the country's large population, natural resources, and strategic location. However, several challenges include inadequate infrastructure, limited skilled labor, and bureaucratic hurdles. The proposed policy recommendations include improving infrastructure, providing vocational education and training, and streamlining regulations to attract foreign investment. The significance of this study lies in its focus on the potential of the manufacturing industry to create formal employment opportunities and reduce informal employment, which can contribute to poverty reduction and economic development in Indonesia. The study's novelty lies in its comprehensive analysis of the challenges and opportunities for industrialization in Indonesia and the proposed policy recommendations to address them.</p>

                <p class="research-meta">Conference Proceeding (2023)</p>
                  <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>This study analyzes the challenges and potential solutions for strengthening Indonesia's social protection network towards a welfare state system. Despite recent economic growth, poverty and inequality persist, necessitating a robust social protection network. The purpose is to identify limitations in the current system and recommend ways to transition towards a welfare state. Objectives include analyzing implementation challenges, examining potential solutions, and assessing the implications of proposed recommendations. Employing a qualitative approach, data was collected through literature reviews, government reports, and policy documents using purposive sampling. Findings indicate limitations, including inadequate coverage, targeting, and funding. Recommendations for strengthening the system include expanding coverage, improving targeting mechanisms, increasing funding, and enhancing stakeholder coordination. This study comprehensively analyses the challenges and potential solutions for strengthening Indonesia's social protection network towards a welfare state. Recommendations can inform policymakers and stakeholders in developing effective policies and programs to enhance social protection and improve the lives of vulnerable populations. The study's originality lies in its holistic approach to examining the social protection system in Indonesia and proposing practical solutions for transitioning towards a welfare state.</p>

                <h3>COVID-19 in Indonesia: Critics and Proposal</h3>
                <p class="research-meta">Conference Proceeding (2022)</p>
                  <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>COVID-19 has been a critical event that we are currently facing. Amidst this uncertain time, the Indonesian government is unable to resist the commercialization practice that exists in medical service, particularly for the COVID-19 cases. In addition to that, intractable neoliberalism led to health inequalities and unequal distribution; uncentralized policy triggered uncontrollable prices. As a result, those practice is harm people in the economic and health sectors. In a simple manner, the COVID-19 outbreak exposed the appalling circumstance of Indonesian healthcare infrastructure resilience. This paper aims to find out the existing commercialization practice of the healthcare service, which should be public goods, and its implication for the people. The research is conducted by utilizing the qualitative research method that includes interviews and secondary data collecting. With the emphasis on criticizing a medical neoliberalism practice, the paper also provides a proposal for the related issue. Regarding the proposals, the paper offers three suggestions: 1) prioritize the preventive measure, 2) prioritize the health budget allocation, and 3) educate people to get used to the self-testing.</p>

                <p class="research-meta">Conference Proceeding (2021)</p>
                  <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>After the fall of the Soviet Union thereafter the Cold War, the rivalry between the United States and Russia remains prevalent. This paper seeks to find why Russia is protesting the U.S. plan to pace military equipment in Eastern Europe. The Eastern European Region is located in the eastern part of the European continent, consisting of post-Soviet Union countries. These countries are often associated with the term "Eastern Bloc" during the Cold War. Using power transition theory, the author will be explaining the nature of war concerning power in international relations. Additionally, power transition theory shows that hegemony's increasing power and rivalry tends to be difficult to resolve by peaceful means. In compiling this research, the author used the descriptive qualitative method. The form of the method used is Literature Review or library research. After collecting the data, the writer will analyze using explanatory research and take a conclusion. The study found that in the wake of the Ukraine conflict and Russian hostility towards NATO, the United States has proven to be the most committed and capable ally of the Central and Eastern European (CEE) states as the controlling power in the region.</p>

                <h3>Indonesia's Government's Role to Secure Vaccine Distribution in the Time of COVID-19 by Using Digital Diplomacy</h3>
                <p class="research-meta">Undergraduate Thesis (2022)</p>
                  <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>This undergraduate thesis examines the Indonesian
government's digital diplomacy role in securing vaccine
doses at the international level. At the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, all global political and economic
activities are knocked down. In anticipation to mitigate the
virus transmission, in-person meetings between state actors
are reduced and highly impact multilateral-based
cooperation. Without the requirement of face-to-face
meetings, the practise of digital diplomacy becomes a good
alternative way for all governments to keep connected and
coordinate with each other related to the COVID-19

handling. As the leading digital diplomacy actor in the Indo-
Pacific, the Indonesian government actively participates in

multilateral virtual meetings, most precisely the global
vaccine alliance for COVID-19, named COVAX. This
research shows that the Indonesian digital diplomacy role in
the COVAX Engagement Group is significant; it is shown
by the numbers of COVID-19 vaccines received by
Indonesia through the COVAX AMC scheme.</p>
